# Parking Now

Project for: **COGS 120 / CSE 170**

Collaborators: **Steven Tran, Angela Liu, Chiao Wang**

Park Now is a mobile web app design to assist UCSD students in the horrendous task known as parking

**Project Description**

This is a parking assistant application aimed to help UCSD students more quickly find 
parking on campus.

This application logs users in using TritonLink SSO, so it has access to user's 
current class schedules.

It allows users to view current parking conditions across all parking lots and 
parking structures on campus in real-time.

Users can enable notifications on a parking area of their choice to recieve updates
as to when parking lots are filling up or are full. 

Users also have the ability to set reminders for when to leave their home in the 
morning to guaruntee parking on campus.

Need to edit the CSS to be used correctly on mobile sites.

Need to also make the buttons and links consistent

Need to make sure all the buttons and tabs on the bottom stay static when scrolling
